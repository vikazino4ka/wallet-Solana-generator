## Getting Started

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Project Build Instructions

This project utilizes C++ and depends on several libraries. We recommend using **vcpkg** for easy dependency management.

### Installing Dependencies with vcpkg:

1.  If you don't have **vcpkg**, clone the repository and install it according to the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system's PATH environment variable.
3.  Run the following commands to install the dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install openssl
    ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install nlohmann-json
    ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install cryptopp
    ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install libsodium
    ```

4.  Build the project after installing the dependencies.

### Building with Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Make sure that **vcpkg** is properly integrated with your environment. (See [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio)).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be located in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and are accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line Usage

Here's how to use the command-line interface:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start a brute-force search for wallets with a balance.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking a particular address. The program will monitor activity.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets. Replace `<NUMBER>` with the desired quantity.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet data from a given mnemonic. Replace `<MNEMONIC>` with the mnemonic phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Show the balance of the specified address in the Solana network.
